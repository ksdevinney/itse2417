# Java Programming- ITSE 2417

These are my notes from Java Programming, taken at Dallas College in summer 2022. This class focused on the basics of Java. Topics covered include methods, objects, classes, data types, loops, and decision structures. 

The book used for this class did not have long chapters with many details, instead each section was mostly focused on activity completion. As a result, my notes are not very thorough. For some sections, this method of learning was helpful because I was able to see how certain concepts would look and function in a program. However, some of the later chapters felt a bit lacking.
